Energy efficiency is a major challenge for the utilities. Due to ever increasing population the demand for energy consumption is also increasing. This in turn raises issues related to the increasing scarcity of natural resources, accelerating pollution, looming the threat of global climate change.
To improve the efficiency of distribution systems and to reduce the amount of energy consumers it becomes imperious to analyse and understand the energy needs of the consumers at a highly spatial level. Forecasting energy demands would provide useful information to make decisions on energy generation and purchase. Furthermore, it would play a significant impact on preventing overloading and allowing an efficient energy storage.
