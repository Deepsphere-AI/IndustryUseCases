"Let me preface my review by saying that I really liked Dr. Dydell. However, as a result of my last experience, I decided to switch doctors. Essentially, she flagged a blood result  as possibly abnormal - even though the lab did not flag the result as abnormal...which is fine. Sometimes, there are subtleties that computerized lab results may not identify. However, she told me she didn't know what further tests to run and sent me to a specialist. When I arrived with my lab results in hand, the specialist looked at them, told me she had no idea why Dr. Dydell had sent me to her because my lab results were normal, and sent me home. This was a complete waste of my time. I feel like doctors should err on the side of caution. However, Dr. Dydell seemed to lack the ability to distinguish normal from abnormal lab results or to know when it's appropriate to send a patient to a specialist. I feel a bit bad writing this review because she was very personable but this was an incredibly strange experience that I don't want to repeat."
"Wonderful Doctor! Great listener, thorough, very smart. An excellent diagnostician. Grateful for her care."
"This doctor gets off on messing with people she was refusing to fill out bloodwork forms for a work wellness program because I hadn't seen her in person even though my work had said just the bloodwork was fine. I kept pushing the point and said I would find a new doctor after this because she also was very unhelpful in letting me know what PTs and therapists are covered, and I couldn't believe she was refusing to fill out the forms-I've never had a doctor be so obstinate for no reason about something so petty. Anyway just to spite me she then signed the forms BLANK, stating I hadn't gotten bloodwork done, which is a blatant lie the results are there on my portal from this year. That's right, she perjured her signature and wanted to waste lab resources on repeat labs just to spite a patient. This person should not be interacting with patients she's horrible Sutter health is also the most terrible insurance I've ever had join Brown and Toland if you have blue shield HMO please save yourselves!"
"I HATE THIS PLACE. Â I really do. The facility is nice, and they're able to get you in in a timely fashion. Â The staff is nice.. Those are the pros.The receptionist had my insurance information but wanted to see the physical card rather than actually just verifying my name. She has more information about my insurance than my insurance card would have had. Asked my husband to email the card while I was there: it was in vein. I was there to remove an arm implant for birth control. They wanted a urine sample to determine if I was pregnant. They never told me they needed a sample.. I just voided my bladder 10 minutes prior. What's the point? I'm here to REMOVE BC. If I was pregnant were they going to leave it in my arm? Of course not. If I'm not pregnant, you're still going to remove it. Just say you want a reason to bill my insurance for extra items. I would have respected that. Then their consent form that clearly no one reads, including them. I disagreed because I didn't want to be video taped or photographed. One of the Dr's said I don't have permission to record in the office. I told her that's NOT at all what this says. It said ""I agree to be video taped, photographed or filmed...."" Â this is the 3rd and final time I'm dealing with their incompetence.*previous appointment was they needed to test my breast milk. The sample collected was insufficient and I never received the results I needed. That was a waste of time, breast milk, and lab testing. *** 1st appointment with them was when I was pregnant. I had several questions. They were giving me answers, but not answering my questions. I even re-worded my questions, and she would say the same thing. Â I immediately left and found a midwife for my prenatal care.I don't need nice staff if you're unable to address my concerns and questions to my satisfaction about my health. At this point I wouldn't trust them with a mosquitoe bite."
