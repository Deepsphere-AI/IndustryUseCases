There are 6 main traits of human intelligence, reasoning Planning Problem Solving Language Production Comprehension Decision Making Human Intelligence is based on the variants they encounter in life & responses. Artificial Intelligence is designed or developed for specific tasks only & its applicability. Humans learn & make decisions from experienced scenarios. Artificial Intelligence makes a decision based on learning from the patterns in the dataset. Humans have tendancy to commit errors. Artificial Intelligence is accurate than human intelligence as it performed by a machine. Artificial Intelligence The human intellect supports multitasking as evidenced by diverse and simultaneous roles. Artificial Intelligence is highly objective in decision making as it analyzes based on purely gathered data. Humans are much better at social interaction since they can process abstract information. Artificial Intelligence has not mastered the ability to pick up on pertinent social and emotional cues. Human Intelligence is much Superior as it comes naturally Artificial Intelligence as the name suggests is artificial, created by humans Emotional Intelligence is the ability or capability to analyze and understand your own emotions and also that of others by having empathy for them. Self Awareness Self Management Social Awareness Relationship Management Empathy, gratitude, happiness, someone’s mood are reserved for Emotional Intelligence and humans today Emotional intelligence to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments. Emotional intelligence is a manifestation of the living.Emotional intelligence is a subset of both intelligence and AI which understands emotions of others. Artificial intelligence hardly or does not have emotions.Artificial intelligence imitates human thought and action by analyzing data and surroundings to a variety of tasks. Artificial Intelligence is as the name suggests is artificial. Artificial intelligence is a word used for intelligence shown by a non-biological species. Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer\\x02controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.\" With the help of AI, you can create such software or devices which can solve real\\x02world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc. With the help of AI, you can build such Robots which can work in an environment where survival of humans can be at risk. AI opens a path for other new technologies, new devices, and new Opportunities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. This means creating algorithms to classify, analyze, and draw predictions from data. It also involves acting on data, learning from new data, and improving over time.
